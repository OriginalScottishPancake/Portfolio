            <p>Vice Noire is a game I created using Unity and C#. It’s been a cool project where I got to dive into
                building gameplay and making things look great. Using Unity’s engine, I was able to put together all the
                different parts of the game, like how the player moves and how enemies act, using C# to make it all come
                together. It’s been a fun way to learn about game development and see how everything works in a real
                game!</p>
            <p>I love writing drama stories in my notebook a lot, once during my English assignment, I have written
                a story named 'Vice Noire'.
                <br> Vice Noire is a passion project of mine, where you play as the Detective trying to solve the
                biggest crime case in the city. <br><br> Even though this game isn't finished yet, I still plan on
                working on it whenever I can.
