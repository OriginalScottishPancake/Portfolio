        <div id="Text">
            <p>I’ve really enjoyed working on my game projects, and I wanted to share a bit about three of my favorites:
                Vice Noire, Vice Shooter, and Beardman Adventures.
            </p>

            <p>Vice Noire was a chance for me to dive deeper into Unity and explore building immersive
                gameplay and visuals. It was a fun challenge to combine different elements and really pushed me to learn
                more about game development.</p>

            <p>Vice Shooter came next, and it was my very first project in Unity. I experimented with
                gameplay mechanics and got hands-on experience with C# scripting. It was a great introduction to
                bringing game ideas to life, and I learned a lot along the way.</p>

            <p>Finally, there’s Beardman Adventures, my first 2D game! This one’s a cartoony
                side-scrolling shooter where I used characters I found online and applied everything I’d learned so far.
                It was so rewarding to see the project come together and to create something that felt like a real game.
            </p>

            <p>Each of these projects has taught me so much and has definitely fueled my passion to keep creating and
                learning in game development!</p>
