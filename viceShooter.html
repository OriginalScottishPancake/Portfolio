        <div id="Text">
            <p>Vice Shooter was my first game project, and I built it using Unity and C#. It was a fantastic experience
                where I learned the basics of game development. I got to experiment with creating gameplay mechanics,
                like how players shoot and interact with the game environment. Using C# for scripting helped me
                understand how to make everything work smoothly together. It was a fun challenge to bring my ideas to
                life, and it really sparked my interest in making more games!</p>

        <div id="Text">
            <p>Here you have the death system and the health kit! <br> I used my interactable script on the keypad, door
                and medkits! </p>

        <p id="Text">I spent around 2-3 weeks working on Vice Shooter, diving into game development without much prior
            experience. <br> <br> This project became a hands-on learning journey, allowing me to experiment and explore
            the
            creative possibilities in Unity. <br> <br> I found myself fully immersed in designing gameplay elements,
            overcoming
            challenges, and discovering the unique satisfaction that comes from bringing a game concept to life.
            <br><br>Working
            on Vice Shooter was not only fun but also inspired me to create even more games in the future, maybe even
            exploring different genres and styles as my skills continue to grow. <br><br>
