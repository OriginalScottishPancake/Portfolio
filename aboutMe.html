        <h1 id="title">Who am I?</h1>
        <div id="Text"> Hello, my name is Joanne Daniel Corbett, and I’m a Software Development student in Eindhoven,
            the Netherlands. I’m studying Game Development with the goal of becoming a professional game developer in
            the future. My love for video games started early, playing on my dad’s old Gameboy Advance, where I spent
            hours on games like The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap. From there, I moved on to consoles, especially the
            Xbox 360, before eventually shifting to PC gaming. <br><br>

            Video games have always been a huge part of my life, and I’ve been fascinated by the creativity and effort
            that go into making them. It’s amazing to think about all the talented people around the world coming
            together to create these incredible experiences that inspire so many. <br><br>

            My dream has always been to become a game developer, and maybe even a game designer, where I can bring my
            own ideas and passion to life through games.

        <h2 id="title">What are my skills?</h2>
        <div id="Text">
            <p id="title">Hard Skills:</p>
            <p> As a bilingual English speaker, I communicate effectively and can work seamlessly in English-speaking
                environments, which has been beneficial in both collaborative and independent projects. I also have a
                solid foundation in Unity and computer science, allowing me to build and develop game concepts with a
                technical focus. My knowledge of Unity enables me to experiment confidently with game mechanics, design,
                and coding, while my computer science background supports my problem-solving and coding efficiency in
                various programming languages.</p>
            <p id="title">Soft Skills:</p>
            <p> I pride myself on being a dedicated and hard worker, consistently putting in the time
                and effort to
                achieve high-quality results. I’m passionate about learning and always look for opportunities to expand
                my knowledge and skills. My adaptability and perseverance have helped me overcome challenges and stay
                focused on project goals, even when faced with obstacles. I thrive in team settings where I can
                communicate openly, and I value constructive feedback to improve and grow in my field.</p>
            <p id="title">Why should I be hired?</p>
            <p>People should hire me because I bring a strong willingness to learn and grow, paired with a foundation in
                Unity and computer science that I'm continually building on. While I’m still a student in game
                development, my projects and hands-on experience have already deepened my understanding, and I am eager
                to keep improving. As a bilingual communicator, I collaborate effectively in English-speaking
                environments and enjoy exchanging ideas to drive creative, team-based solutions. <br> <br>

                I’m dedicated, hardworking, and approach every project as an opportunity to develop my skills. I believe
                that with the right guidance and challenges, I can make a meaningful impact, and I’m excited to bring my
                passion for game development, adaptability, and commitment to any team willing to invest in a motivated
                learner. By hiring me, you’re gaining not only someone who’s ready to contribute but also someone who’s
                constantly pushing to become better.</p>
